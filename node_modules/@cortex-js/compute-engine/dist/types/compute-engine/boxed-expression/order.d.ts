 * Given two expressions `a` and `b`, return:
 * - `-1` if `a` should be ordered before `b`
 * - `+1` if `b` should be ordered before `a`
 * - `0` if they have the same order (they are structurally equal)
 *
 * The default order is as follow:
 *
 * 1/ Literal numeric values (rational,  machine numbers and Decimal numbers),
 *  ordered by their numeric value (smaller numbers before larger numbers)
 *
 * 2/ Literal complex numbers, ordered by their real parts. In case of a tie,
 * ordered by the absolute value of their imaginary parts. In case of a tie,
 * ordered by the value of their imaginary parts.
 *
 * 3/ Symbols, ordered by their name as strings
 *
 * 4/ Addition, ordered as a polynom, with higher degree terms first
 *
 * 5/ Other functions, ordered by their `complexity` property. In case
 * of a tie, ordered by the operator of the expression as a string. In case of a
 * tie, by the leaf count of each expression. In case of a tie, by the order
 * of each argument, left to right.
 *
 * 6/ Strings, ordered by comparing their Unicode code point values. While this
 * sort order is quick to calculate, it can produce unexpected results, for
 * example "E" < "e" < "Ãˆ" and "11" < "2". This ordering is not suitable to
 * collate natural language strings.
 *
 * See https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Sort.html for a
 * description of the ordering of expressions in Mathematica.
